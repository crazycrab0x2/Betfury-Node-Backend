Modefied Backend Feature

-register // controller/authController/userRegister_new

	when users register, ther send only username, email, password, currency, country, phone.

	dis_currency will be set currency of request.(I don't know what dis_currency is and I use this field in gameControllerNew to openGame).

	user_users schema changed(
		deposited: original - bool, now - number (if user deposit money, deposited will increase by one - frontend will change according to deposited count)

		added freespin (Object, default - {count: 3, lastSpin: Date.now() - 7200000, lastDepoist: Date.now()} it is used in feespin method in gameControllerNew)

		changed 'status' default value as 'allow'
		
		added recentPlay (Array)
	)

- controller/gameControllerNew

	in openGame() I used users dis_currency for game.

	getGameListsCG(), getGameListsBO(), getGameListsRyan() : load games and game providers(vendor) from providers(CasinoGold, BlueOcean, Ryan)

	openDemoGame(), getDemoGameLaunchUrlOfGame(), openGame(), getGameLaunchUrlOfGame() methods changed and work well.

	getGames(), getGameChild(), getProviders() - little changed, work well

	getGamesBySlug() -get game data with unique field 'slug'. (on frontend, gameplay page url is "/game/[slug]", call getGameBySlug api when refresh)

	freespin() - forntend has wheel and this endpoint is called when user rotate wheel

	user_session schema changed(
		added gameProfile (Object, it is used in gameControllerNew and integration files. contains game data user opend)
	)

	gameList schema changed(
		launchUrlId: 1-casinogold, 2-blueocean, 3-ryan
		slug: unique identifier of game. (generated in getGameListsCG(), getGameListsBO(), getGameListsRyan())
	)

	*issue on getGames()
	sort({opens: -1}) returns unexpected result because after load games from providers 'opens' feild of games is 0.

-controller/integrationCG
	
	contains callback methods for CasinoGold
	no issue, works well.

-controller/integrationBO
	
	contains callback methods for BlueOcean -endpoint() and Ryan - ryan()
	no issue, works well.

-controller/walletController
	
	we used nowpayments.io for crypto deposit
	cryptoDeposit(), nowpaymentCallback(), getEstimateAmount()
